# Challenges

Welcome to my **Challenges** repository — a personal collection of solved programming problems from various platforms. This repository is an ongoing project, and I will keep adding more solutions as I solve new problems.

## About This Repository

This repo is a workspace where I store my solutions to coding problems from two main platforms:

### Edabit

* My early coding journey started here.
* I solved **over 200 problems** on Edabit, mostly during the first stages of learning programming.
* Unfortunately, I lost access to my old Edabit account and some solutions, but I am adding what I still have here as a record of that experience.

### LeetCode

* Currently, LeetCode is my main platform for problem solving and practice.
* I have solved **more than 200 problems** on LeetCode and continue to work on more regularly.
* You can check my profile and progress here: [leetcode.com/u/mohos05](https://leetcode.com/u/mohos05/)

## Why This Repository?

* To keep track of my progress and growth as a programmer.
* To have a centralized place to revisit, improve, and share my solutions.
* To inspire others by sharing problem-solving approaches and coding practice.

## How To Use

Feel free to explore the solutions, learn from the code, and adapt them to your own learning journey. If you have questions or want to collaborate, you can contact me or open an issue.
